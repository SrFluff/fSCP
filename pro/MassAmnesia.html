		<h1>Mass Amnesia</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Background</h2><p>
		The mass amnesia protocol is a more modern protocol developed to protect the
		world from memetic anomalies. This protocol is a more general application of
		the council data removal protocol to mematic information. Due to it's age,
		the mass amnesia protocol was developed in collaboration with council members
		c-0 to <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>. This protocol was not developed until the
		organization's containment of the first memetic anomaly in <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>.

		<h2>Core concepts</h2><p>
		To counter the effects of mematic anomalies the mass use of amnestics must be
		approved. The current plan is to disperse amnestics thorugh the water supply
		and mandated injections. While the mass use of amnestics can be seen as dangerous,
		the organization recognizes that a 5-10% death toll is within reason for a mass
		memory wipe. During the execution of the mass amnesia protocol, all G.C.O.
		employees with security clearance 3 and above are to not recieve amnestics less
		they be affected by a mematic or explicitly, and of their own volition, request
		amnestics be administered. Under no circumstances are the head council to take
		any amnestics above level 5, any rhetoric that indicates otherwise is false and
		should be reported immediately.
