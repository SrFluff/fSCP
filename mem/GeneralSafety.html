		<hr>
		<h3>From: LBrent@goc.net | To: all@goc.net</h3><p>
		Dear all organization staff, this is a mandatory message that is to be read
		by all faculty. This internal communication is in regards to general safety
		when handling anomalous entities. Due to the Global Cryptid Organization's
		sheer number of contained anomalies, this message will go very in-depth.<br>
		<br>
		The most basic rule that all staff are to follow is to report all irregular
		behaviors to your superior. If you are a facility manager then you are to
		communicate directly with the G.C.O's head council. Other than irregular
		behavior, if you are unsure if you belong in a wing, then you probably do
		not, and should consult a facility manager or any of your superiors. A
		very important reminder that any unauthorized access is punishable by,
		and will result in, immediate termination of both employment and life.<br>
		<br>
		The following section regards memetic, anti-memetic, and self-referential
		anomalies, read with caution. If you are in the presence of a memetic entity
		then, as soon as it is safe, immediately report to a superior to be administered
		class 4 and above amnestics. If you are found retaining forbidden knowledge
		then you will be punished accordingly as mentioned previously. In the presence
		of an anti-memetic entity it is suggested that, once safe, you consult a
		superior, to be administered class 2 and above mnestics, so that you may
		correctly report the event. If you encounter a self-referential or
		mentally impossible anomaly, please keep in mind that, most likely, you
		will not be able to trust your own mind, until administered gnostics or
		relinquished from the anomaly's effects. Any encounters with self-referential
		anomalies outside of testing purposes MUST be reported to the head council.<br>
		<br>
		In regards with anomalies capable of end-of-the-world scenarios, you are to
		follow the letter of internal law as close as the laws of physics will let you.
		It is of utmost importance that all faculty understand that failure to comply
		with safety standards in the presence of such dangerous anomalies will not
		only result in your death, but most likely the near, or full, extinction of
		the human race, and the G.C.O. If you believe you are about to do something
		dangerous, idiotic, or useless, then stop what you're doing, and immediately
		check yourself into psychological evaluation.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you for reading this document.<br>
		- Dr. Brent (Facility manager(f-09))
