		<h3>From: JGrole@gco.net | To: all@gco.net</h3><p>
		This internal memo seeks to explain the security levels, and their corresponding
		code names. Following the publication of this document within organization
		servers all mentions of the old, arbitrary, security level system.<br>
		<br>
		The lowest level of clearance is level 0, pingus. These are expendable human
		beings taken from death row. Level 0s, or pingi, have very few rights, and
		are not to be left unsupervised. They also server as the primary test subjects
		in all, or most, organization experiments.<br>
		<br>
		One tier above pingus is level 1, eques. Equi are the G.C.O.'s private military
		responsible for super basic recaptures and pingi supervision. They are also
		all G.C.O. facilities' first line of defense.<br>
		<br>
		For more specialized recaptures and containment procedures the organization has
		a higher ranked military picked from he best of the equi. These are level 2s, or
		episcopus. Episcopi are tasked with the recapture of high risk euclid-class
		anomalies and keter-class anomalies. They are also the main line of defense
		for the heavier containment sectors within G.C.O. facilities.<br>
		<br>
		Outranking the episcopi, are the level 3s, turri. The turri are the organization's
		research division, and are responsible for planning the majority of all
		organization experiments.<br>
		<br>
		For more secretive work, or more important work, there is a research division
		above turris, the monachi: level 4s. They handle research on high risk euclid-class
		anomalies and ketter-class anomalies.<br>
		<br>
		The organization's head council has their own military, these stand at level 5
		and are code named basileus. They are sworm in for life by the members of the
		head council. The basili must undergo intense mental fortitude training to
		serve the council. They are also authorized to replace the council, if it is
		to ever cease to exist.<br>
		<br>
		For any further concerns regarding security clearance, please consult a facilty
		manager.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you for reading this internal memo<br>
