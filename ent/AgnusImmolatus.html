		<h2>Background</h2>
		<b>
		WARNING: THIS PROTOCOL IS ONE OF FEW THAT GO DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION'S
		MISSION, AND IS SOLEY TO BE USED A FINAL-RESORT. DUE TO THIS PROTOCOL'S AGE IT
		CANNOT BE STRUCK FROM ORGANIZATION SERVERS.
		</b>
		<p>
		Agnus Immolatus(Sacrificial Lamb) was first establish near the birth of the organization.
		Due to it's age and contents, the majority of related information was never, or poorly,
		recorded. It is assumed to have been created by head council member C-<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Core concepts</h2>
		<p>
		Agnus immolatus is to be used against spiritual and/or religious anomalies.
		Such cases would be rapture-adjacent events, mass extinctions of higher and/or
		divine origin, or other religious end-of-the-word events.<br>
		<br>
		To execute this protocol the organization must keep at least five orphans
		within deep, live-organism, storage and be fully commited to the execution
		of all reserved orphans. If the organization deems this protocol necessary
		then they must all be layed down on an altar of any type and stabbed through
		the heart, one by one. Due to factors outside of the organization's knowledge
		this has been theorized to appease higher beings.<br>
		<br>
		This protocol also demands that the organization personnel tasked with the
		execution of the designated orphans MUST be of a religion practiced by over
		20% of the modern world. All sacrifices and altars must be held outside
		and below clear skies. The organization reccommends the immediate termination
		and death of the person who was tasked with the execution.
