		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A-026-OMICRON is a theoretically infinite void filled sparsely with particles of <a href="026-omicron-delta.html">026-OMICRON-DELTA</a>, and containing
		<a href="026.html">A-026</a> until it's expected transverse into Earth and it's reality. 026-OMICRON-DELTA is incredibly unstable and filled with energy.
		All organization attempts to contain an instance of 026-OMICRON-DELTA have resulted in loss of equipment or loss of life. Electromagnetic readings
		from within 026-OMICRON have shown that 026-OMICRON-DELTA is either plentiful enough, or charged enough, that it has generated a very strong
		electromagnetic field within 026-OMICRON that is theorized to be the sole source of 026's delayed entrance.

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		All attempts made to explore 026-OMICRON have failed spectacularly. The space has been shown to instantly disintegrate most organic matter
		and quicken the degradation of artificial matter. Through the use of specialized electromagentic sensors the organization has had a few
		peeks into this void. It is through the sensors that we have be able to estimate both the size of 026-OMICRON, and 026's current state.
		<br><br>
		026-OMICRON's main purpose is to contain 026, and serve as an incinerator for most natural items. The organization has yet to utilize 026-OMICRON
		to attempt the destruction of items due to unforseen circumstances.
