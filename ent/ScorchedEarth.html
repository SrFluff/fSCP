		<h1>Scorched Earth Protocol</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		The scorched Earth protocol was the first, and is the most drastic, of all
		organization developed protocols and is to be used solely as a last-resort
		protocol in a situation where all other protocols would fail to preserve
		the world, the human race, and the organization. This policy may only be
		enacted by the Global Cryptid Organization's head council, unless exigent
		circumstances render the head council inept.
		<hr>
		<h2>Core concepts</h2>
		<p>
		The scorched Earth policy will result in the utter and complete destruction
		of not only the planet Earth but also the reality in which it resides. While
		this protocol is more nonspecific than other, by sheer nature of its
		seniority, it is to result in the following <b>WITHOUT EXCEPTION:</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The complete destruction of the planet Earth(and by extension the human race)</li>
			<li>The permanent removal of all traces of human impact on the entirety of the reality</li>
			<li>The complete and utter destruction and removal of any chances or hopes of restoring humanity or, by extent,
					the organization.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		While the protocol may only be enacted by the Global Cryptid Organization's
		head council in typical circumstances, the organization does recognize that if
		this protocol is deemed to be necessary, then the situation is
		unlikely to be typical. In the event where the organization's head
		council no longer exists, then all remaining organization faculty are to
		collectively decide whether or not to execute this protocol. If the council
		no longer exists but has left specific instructions, then all faculty are to
		follow direct orders from the council.
