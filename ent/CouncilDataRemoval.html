		<h1>Council Data Removal Protocol</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		The council data removal protocol was created with, and evolves alongside, the GCO's head council.
		Data removal originally began as a set of processes that merely mean to redact physical documents and photos,
		but, in the organization's attempts to maintain modernity, these processes now not only edit digital and physical media,
		but also focus on the permanent removal of, not only digital but physical,
		media as well through the use of the organization's vast resources.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Core concepts</h2>
		<p>
		To properly remove any data it must first meet any of the following requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>Contains any information that can be used to identify any members of the head council</li>
			<li>Can be used to expand recorded information regarding the head council</li>
			<li>Can be used to put the head council in danger, or undermine their position</li>
		</ul>
		If any piece of media meets any of these requirements, then, in order to properly remove it, the following steps must be followed:
		<ul>
			<li>If the piece of media is physical, then all iterations of the media must be destroyed enough that any sentient and intelligent
					beings may no longer use it to relate it to the head council</li>
			<li>If the media is digital then all organization resources are cleared for use in removing the data from not only the internet,
					but all computers across all realities</li>
			<li>For any other non-specific cases that do not match the last two procedures, then the media is to be completely destroyed,
					enough so that no trace is to be left behind</li>
		</ul>
		If <b>ANY</b> media is found containing council information,
		and no active attempt to remove it is underway(less there be exigent circumstances),
		then all parties involved will be executed or otherwise punished accordingly.
