		<h2>Description</h2><p>
		A-056 is a small bar of 36% zinc, 71% copper, and 206% human flesh. A-056 is a
		large traffic cone first discovered eight million feet underground. A-056 is
		a three feet tall steak that has been shown to consume live subjects within
		eight feet. A-056 is a factory located deep within the Yukon, as of now it is
		unknown what it produces. A-056 is an eight feet tall humanoid with a long
		black coat and a top hat, it has been recorded showing itself only to people
		under the effects of heavy hallucinogens.<br>

		It was a cold day, the heat making me dizzy, the forest around me seemed endless,
		the dunes never ended. As I kept walking, the water kept rising until I could
		barely see in front of me from all the smoke. The small bushes were filled with
		spikes, a detail I failed to comprehend as the mountain became steeper and
		steeper and steeper and steeper.<br>

		<br><br>
		A-056 is a forgetful person's nightmare and dream. Not only is A-056
		cognitohazardous, but also anti-memetic. The previous writing from
		within this article is anomalous in that, not only do they change
		every time you read it but, it cannot be deleted in any way shape or
		form. The more I write the more I fear I am losing touch with the
		mnestic in my system. People under the effects of A-056 cannot
		distinguish between lucidity and the absolutely insane mental
		state that A-056 thrust unto the mind. I will stop writing for
		fear that I may write something contradictory. To sign off, I
		did not write these words and this page does not exist.

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2><p>
		A-056 can be contained within an &infin; x &infin; x &infin; room.
		The walls must be composed of sky, and the floor of floor. The ceiling must
		be below the windows above the floor next to the walls above the roof right
		next to the ceiling. A-056 cannot be contained and will not be contained and
		chooses not to be contained and doesn't know how to be contained.
