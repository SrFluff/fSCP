		<h2>Description</h2>
		188 is an ever-growing 'blanket' of mammalian flesh that idles at ~38C. 188 was first discovered in the <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>
		mountains in <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>-1988, at around 216m by 724m. 188 appears to grow in colder environments, the only
		known way to 'shrink' 188 is by heating it up to around 100C and pouring a mixture of sulfur and mercury on its surface.
		Any physical contact with 188 will result in small spines on its surface injecting a potent neurotoxin(henceforth referred
		to as 188-GAIA) into the subject's circulatory system/ 188-GAIA has shown to kill average humans in about two minutes and
		incur rapid decomposition. Once a subject has been completely decomposed, 188 will move in to 'consume' the subject, growing
		after 'consuming' the subject.
		<br>
		<br>
		Though it was initially believed that 188 was incapable of growing without sustenance, this was proven wrong by a test conducted
		by Dr. <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>. When left unperturbed for prolonged periods of time, 188 begins to grow at about 1m&sup2 per day.
		The only way to slow this unattended growth is throught the use of heat and the afforementioned sulfur-mercury mixture.
		The organization has found that, through the use of enough heat and chemical mixtures, growth can be completely impeded.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>(NOTE: The term 'blanket' was coined by one doctor <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> upon discovery of 188, this term is not officially
			organization sanctioned)</i>
		<hr>
		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		188 is to be held in a 3m x 3m x 6m concrete heated cell. The cell is to constantly maintained at 200C with bi-weekly sprinklers
		used to disperse a sulfur-mercury mix onto 188. Under NO circumstances are facility staff allowed to enter 188 cell. In the event
		of a breach facility military staff are to attempt to recontain 188 through the use of flamethrowers and Molotov cocktails.

		<h2>Experiments</h2>
		<p>
		<b>11-03-1989:</b> Three test subjects were forced into skin contact with 188, this resulted in the near-immediate paralyzation of
		the subjects, quickly leading to brain-death. An autopsy revealed the presence of 188-GAIA within the subjects' blood.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>05-22-1990:</b> During a containment breach 188 was lit on fire by A-<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> and showed signs of reduced growth.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>07-09-1990:</b> Upon testing flamethrowers, Molotov cocktails, dragon's breath, and flares: flamethrowers and Molotov cocktails
		were found to be the most effective at impeding 188's growth.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>01-22-1991:</b> Through ceaseless and repetitive testing, a mixture of 82% sulfur, 18% mercury in liquid form was also found to
		damage and impede 188's growth.
