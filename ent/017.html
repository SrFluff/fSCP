		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A-017 is a, purely theoretical, god-adjacent entity. Codenamed "Alphaeus" 017
		could potentially appear near Earth, posing an extra-planar threat. 017 is theorized
		to have a form emulating a large ball of light. Some speculations indicate that 017
		could be cognitohazardous, and upon viewing it people would be compelled to kill
		themselves, or begin floating up into the sky.
		<br><br>
		017 was first proposed on <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>, 1999 by Dr. <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> as part
		of his 'old gods' proposal. 017 is the most legitimate of the four gods proposed, with
		the most amount of feasible characteristics, and likeliest scenario. The other three
		gods are not too dissimilar to 017 though. All three other gods, named in descending feasibility:
		<ul>
			<li>Zebedee</li>
			<li>Thaddaeus</li>
			<li>Iscariot</li>
		</ul>
		share the characteristics of not having a corporeal form, instead being mostly composed
		of energy and/or light. Iscariot is proposed to be formed of 'one million hands' and is
		to theoretically arrive by digging up from the Earth's core, making him a deviation.
		All other gods are similarly cognitohazardous and capable of eliminating the human race
		with little perceived effort.
		<br>
		<br>
		The three other gods would similarly cause a rapture-like event as well. While it is unclear
		what would happen to people, beyond simply floating up or killing themselves, some theories
		state that people would 'become trapped within their own mind for millions of lifetimes',
		resulting in an effective mass torture/anti-rapture. The only protocol currently available
		to the organization in a situation like this would be the <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> protocol, but
		to enact this protocol, the organization would require full council support.
		</p>

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		Currently the only theorized method of eliminating 017 and the other proposed old gods
		would be through a mass sacrifice of the human race. Due to it's contradiction to the
		Global Cryptid Organization's mission these anomalies have been deemed uncontainable.
