		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		In the most standard way, anomaly 001 is the Global Cryptid Organization
		itself. 001 is not just the physical facilities that contain our anomalies,
		but also the personnel, protocols, documents, and actions as well. 001 has
		existed for about <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> years and was founded by the first
		member of the head council(C-0). 001 does not answer to any world governments
		and will use any means deemed necessary to achieve their core mission: to
		maintain the prosperity and protect the ignorant bliss of the human race.
		001 will never and has never worked with outside organizations and any
		requests to do so will be put under heavy investigation before being refused.
		<br>
		<br>
		The organization is spear-headed by the Global Cryptid Organization Head Council.
		The head council is composed of <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> members. The head council
		is an inherently private division and council. Members are identified with a
		numerical pattern(ex. C-n) and all records of any images containing information
		related to the head council is immediately removed both digitally and physically
		through the use of special, council-specific, data-removal protocols.
		</p>

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		By the nature of 001's class, it is not to be contained by to be used to
		contain other anomalies. Even if 001 was deemed in such a state where it
		cannot maintain and uphold it's core mission it is not to be contained but
		to be completely and utterly eviscerated with no trace of it left behind. 001
		poses enough of a threat if gone rogue where containment is to be completely
		ignored and destruction is to be enacted.
		<br>
		<br>
		When it comes to containing anomalies the organization owns <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>
		facilities(as of <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>) where they contain all known and recorded
		anomalies. The organization, along with containing these anomalies, documents and
		performs experiments on their contained experiments. These experiments have lead
		to the general advancement of the human race. This advancement has been masked
		through the use of many world governments and organizations.
