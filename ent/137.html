		<h1>A-137</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
		Class: <b>Safe</b><br>
		Risk: <b>Parvus</b>
		</p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		137 presents itself as a small epithet approximately 24 inches in height, 12 inches in width, and 6 inches in depth. It is, upon
		advanced material analysis, composed of mostly granite with trace amount of carbon-14 and magnesium. It is located in
		Laurel Hill East cemetery in Pennsylvania. While it is technically considered an epithet, it always will have a person buried
		beneath it. The reason it's considered an epithet is due to the fact that, when dug up, the buried person will always change.
		<br>
		<br>
		As of <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> the organization has not yet found a source for the bodies beneath 137. It is believed to pull these
		bodies from nearby graves. Though this hypothesis has not yet been confirmed.

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		While 137 cannot be contained, the organization has made an effort to deter people away from the site of the anomaly. 137's
		current, exact, location is constantly shifting(currently located at <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>) along with it always being locked
		behind iron bars and gates. While these measures are typically enough to keep people away, the organization has also
		placed guards within Laurel Hill's faculty to ensure no tampering with 137.
