		<p>
		Class: <b>Esoteric</b><br>
		Risk: <b>Magnificus</b>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		026 is a mematic entity with a physical form similar to that of a humanoid with bird-like wings. 026's appearance is inherently
		cognitohazardous and upon viewing its form, it causes test subjects to begin producing a low screech until the subject's
		vocal chords physically rip apart. As of now(<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>) 026 is held in a parallel dimension to ours, referred to as
		026-OMICRON but is expected to eventually merge into ours. Upon merging, the Earth's lands would be scorched and the
		world would resemble some interpretations of the rapture. Currently the organization has no estimate on when 026 is to
		merge.
		<br>
		<br>
		While 026-OMICRON is impossible to photograph due to 026's cognitohazardous influence, the organization has been able
		to map out 026-OMICRON with the use of electromagnetic sensors. Currently the sensors cannot be exactly pinpointed due
		to unknown reasons but are correctly transmitting data and have been for the past <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> years.
		Electromagnetic readings have shown that 026-OMICRON is primarily composed of empty space occasionally filled with atoms
		of an unknown, negatively charged, element(026-OMICRON-DELTA). Any attempts to capture these elements for
		research purposes immediately resulted in the violent evisceration of all containment objects.

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		As of <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> the organization does not possess the resources to stop 026 from merging into our dimension, but it
		does have the ability to monitor 026's behavior. As of the past <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> years 026 has remained in a state of
		unchanging stillness and has shown no movement. Despite this, any human exposure to 026 will still result in the person's
		death. Monitoring of 026 is strictly through aforementioned electromagnetic radiation readings, 026 cognitohazardous
		properties persist through digital formats and printed images as well.
		<br>
		<br>
		All electromagnetic sensors stationed in 026-OMICRON are to be checked for data integrity through the use of a 256 byte checksum.
		If any sensors are to be found faulty, a remote self-destruction protocol is to be enacted to destroy the sensor in a
		safe, controlled, manner. Upon removal of a sensor a new one is to be sent into 026-OMICRON and put into operation
		effective immediately

		<h2>Experiments</h2>
		<p>
		<b>11-06-1996</b>: One test subject was sent into 026-OMICRON. Upon returning <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> was found
		emanating a low screech for the next seven hours, eventually leading to the damage of the vocal chords and eventual death.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>5-21-1997</b>: One digital camera was sent into 026-OMICRON. Upon viewing the feed of the camera, all participants
		immediately became unresponsive and began emanating a low screech until terminated by facility staff.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>12-27-1999</b>: One lead lined, ten millimeter thick, remotely operated, box was inserted into 026-OMICRON. Upon capturing
		a molecule of 026-OMICRON-DELTA, the box was immediately eviscerated with enough energy to damage two sensors
		approximately ten miles away.
