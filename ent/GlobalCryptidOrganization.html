		The Global Cryptid Organization, typically referred to as the 'GCO', is an organization established approximately<br>
		<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> years ago. The GCO is tasked with the containment and extermination of all anomalies that pose,<br>
		or have been deemed to pose, a threat to the human race. The GCO contains these anomalies within their<br>
		<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b> facilities. Further information regarding the hierarchy structure and containment protocols can<br>
		either be found on anomaly pages, or pages held under tighter security. The GCO is the sole maintainer of this server and<br>
		collaborates with no other organizations, any information claiming otherwise should not be trusted and should be<br>
		immediately reported to organization officials.
