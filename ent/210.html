		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		210 is a .png file originally found on <b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>.net on 1/16.1995.
		210 presents itself as a very typical, early 2010s, meme of a cat. The meme, when observed,
		never resembles, or has yet to be found to resemble, the same image to different people.
		Upon digitally analyzing the bytes of 210 it presents itself as if it was composed solely of
		empty bytes.
		<br>
		<br>
		Though 210 is completely different for every person, inherently giving it cognitohazardous properties,
		it does follow some simple style rules:
		<ul>
			<li>White text with a black outline in the 'Impact' font, on both the top and bottom.</li>
			<li>An image of an animal, typically a cat or dog, with the background removed in the center.</li>
			<li>A background typically composed of three or more vibrant, solid, colors.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Containment protocol</h2>
		<p>
		Due to 210 relatively harmless nature it is not held under any particularly high containment protocols.
		Instead stored on a 64 gigabyte flash drive stored within f-<b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b>. The only measure taken
		to prevent the spread of 210 is a strict NO-INTERNET policy. Under NO circumstances should 210 be uploaded
		to any websites on the internet. Some organization test have shown prolonged exposure to 210 can have minor
		negative effect on mental health.
